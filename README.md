## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is actually my first project using React and i must say 'I LOVE IT!!!' it's very much easier and enhances higher productivity,I encountered some difficulties but finally solved it, which I'm glad i did.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Card />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Continued development

I would definitely continue using React but i would need to step up my game so i can write better code.I actually believe my file structure is unconventional but i will try to improve that in the nearest future.
